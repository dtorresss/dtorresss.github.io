**Carriages:** 23:15

**Dress Code:** Lounge suits

### Sundía 26th June 2016 – The Garden Party

For many of you we will be dragging you down a long way from home. We really appreciate that and would love to invite you back to the castle for a Garden Party and BBQ on the Sundía.

This will be a relaxed gathering to enjoy the castle, the beautiful dorset coastline and fingers crossed the weather a little more before the reality of Mondía morning. If you’d like to come to this, please just let us know in the RSVP so we know how many we are catering for.

**Start:** 12:00

**Finish:** 15:00

**Dress code:** Casual
